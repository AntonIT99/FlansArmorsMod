# Guns, Ammunition, and Grenades

Read this reference when editing `gun_categories.json`, `aagun_categories.json`,
`bullet_categories.json`, or `grenade_categories.json`.

## Guns

For each identifiable gun, research and normally define:

| Property | Unit | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MuzzleVelocity` | metres per second | Required only when the gun is velocity-authoritative: normal service load from the represented barrel. A cartridge velocity from another barrel length is not equivalent. |
| `RoundsPerMin` | rounds per minute | Mandatory for a gun that fires ammunition; omit on a melee-only gun. Cyclic rate for automatic weapons; credible practical/mechanical rate for manual or semiautomatic weapons. Never use magazine capacity. |
| `Dispersion` | degrees | Mandatory for a gun that fires ammunition; omit on a melee-only gun. Actual angular accuracy/spread for the configuration. Convert MOA with `degrees = MOA / 60`; do not infer it from effective range. |

Keep shotgun dispersion representative of the full shot pattern and ordinary gun
dispersion representative of the base weapon without movement or attachment
modifiers. `MuzzleVelocity` is internally divided by 20 to obtain blocks/tick.
`RoundsPerMin` overrides legacy `ShootDelay`; its delay is `1200 / RPM` ticks.
Treat 1200 RPM as the maximum ordinary supported rate because gun updates occur on
the Minecraft tick cadence.

When reliable research and configuration-compatible game sources cannot establish
either mandatory value, author a gameplay-coherent fallback rather than omitting
it. Base it on the weapon type, action, calibre, era, barrel length, and comparable
already-categorized weapons; do not derive dispersion from effective range. Label
the value as invented in the final report.

### Muzzle-velocity ownership

Choose the primary source for each weapon/ammunition configuration before researching
velocity. Ammunition `MuzzleVelocity` / `BulletSpeed` takes precedence at runtime
when present, so a gun-category `MuzzleVelocity` is a compatible fallback rather
than a competing override:

- **Gun-authoritative:** ordinary simple guns and small arms normally own
  `MuzzleVelocity` in `gun_categories.json`. Use the exact represented barrel and
  service loading. Their ordinary ammunition categories normally omit the key even
  though they still supply projectile `Mass`.
- **Ammunition-authoritative:** autocannon belts, individually selectable cannon
  shells, missiles, and other shell-based patterns own `MuzzleVelocity` in
  `bullet_categories.json`. It is the exact projectile/load velocity for the
  represented gun or barrel. The matching gun or AA-gun category may retain a
  compatible fallback velocity, but it does not override the ammunition value.
- **Weapon-authoritative:** a gun, AA gun, or driveable may restate a shared round
  outright with `AmmoMuzzleVelocity <ammoShortName> <mps>`. This wins over both sides
  above, and it is the correct answer when one generic ammunition item is fired by
  several materially different real barrels. See
  [Per-ammo overrides](#per-ammo-overrides).

The resolved velocity combines with ammunition projectile `Mass` for kinetic damage;
keep both values consistent with the same service loading. When both sides define a
velocity, they must describe compatible configurations. When the same nominal
ammunition is fired from materially different barrels whose velocities must differ,
override on each weapon rather than trying to pick one velocity for the item.

Projectile mass, explosive filler, and penetration belong to ammunition, not gun
categories. Exact aliases and skins may share one gun category; split materially
different calibres, marks, actions, or barrel lengths.

## AA guns

For each identifiable AA gun or complete AA mounting, research and define:

| Property | Unit | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `RoundsPerMin` | firing events per minute | Required. Use the represented mounting's mechanical cadence and interpret it with the definition's barrel behavior as described below. This overrides `ShootDelay` using `1200 / RPM` ticks, as for guns. |
| `Dispersion` | degrees | Required. Convert MOA with `degrees = MOA / 60`; never derive it from range. |
| `RealMassKg` | kilograms | Required firing/operational mass of the complete represented gun and integral mounting, carriage, or shield. Exclude crew, towing vehicle, and non-integral ammunition reserves. |
| `UseRealisticVehicleHealth` | quoted boolean | Required as `"true"`. Total entity HP becomes `realisticVehicleHealthScale * RealMassKg^(2/3)`, rounded to the nearest integer with a minimum of one. |

`Health` remains the legacy fallback. If realistic health is requested without a
valid positive `RealMassKg`, the loader reports a warning and retains authored
`Health`. AA guns have one health pool, so unlike driveables there are no hitbox
weights to allocate.

`RoundsPerMin` describes firing events, not automatically the sum of every barrel's
projectile output. Inspect `NumBarrels`, `FireAlternately`, and `NumBullets` in the
actual definition:

- With `FireAlternately true`, one barrel fires per event. Use the documented total
  system rate; if the source only gives an independently cycling per-barrel rate,
  multiply by the number of barrels when the mounting actually staggers them.
- With `FireAlternately false`, every loaded barrel fires in the same event. If the
  source gives a per-barrel cyclic rate, use that rate. If it gives only combined
  projectile output, divide by `NumBarrels * NumBullets` to obtain event RPM.
- The modeled projectile output is event RPM multiplied by `NumBullets`, and also
  by `NumBarrels` for non-alternating fire. Do not multiply a documented combined
  rate a second time.

Minecraft permits at most one AA-gun firing event per tick, so 1200 event RPM is
the ordinary maximum representable cadence. A simultaneous multi-barrel mounting
may legitimately emit more than 1200 projectiles per minute while remaining at or
below 1200 firing events per minute.

When reliable research and configuration-compatible game sources cannot establish
AA-gun `RoundsPerMin` or `Dispersion`, author a gameplay-coherent fallback rather
than omitting it. Base it on the gun calibre, era, mounting, barrel count, firing
mode, and comparable categorized AA guns; report it explicitly as invented.

Projectile mass, muzzle velocity, explosive filler, penetration, and belt/shell
composition belong to the compatible `bullet_categories.json` entries because
`AAGunType` takes flight and damage data from its ammunition. Add exact
`UseAmmoGroup` mappings when a compatible ammunition family exists, and validate
both sides of the group. `Recoil`, reload timing, view limits, targeting, and sound
settings are gameplay/configuration properties, not mandatory historical category
statistics unless the task specifically includes balancing them.

## Ammunition: classify the content pattern first

Every bullet category is exactly one of:

1. Ordinary gun ammunition selected by a gun definition.
2. A mixed small-cannon/autocannon belt represented by `AddRound`.
3. An individually selectable cannon shell or missile joined through
   `AddToAmmoGroup`.
4. Dropped or released ordnance carried by a driveable: bombs, depth charges, naval
   mines, and torpedoes. See [Bombs and dropped ordnance](#bombs-and-dropped-ordnance).

Inspect `Bomb True`, `Shell True`, `Missile True`, `Torpedo True`, `WeaponType`,
`RoundsPerItem`, all consuming guns/vehicles/aircraft, and neighboring definitions
before choosing a pattern.

### Ordinary gun ammunition

Every category requires:

- `Mass`: projectile/bullet mass in grams, never complete cartridge, case,
  propellant, or loaded-magazine mass.
- `FallSpeed: 1.0` for ordinary ballistic projectiles. Omit it, or use a separately
  justified value, only for a self-propelled projectile capable of sustaining its
  flight.

Also define when applicable:

| Property | Unit | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `PenetrationAt100m` | millimetres | Perpendicular penetration at 100 m, preferably comparable RHA, for AP and heavy anti-materiel rounds. The game currently applies the authored value at every range despite the key name. |
| `ExplosiveMassTNTg` / `ExplosiveMassTNTKg` | grams / kilograms TNT equivalent | Only for explosive ammunition; derive from filler mass/composition, never total projectile mass. |
| `FlakParticles` | particle count | Legacy visual count, not fragment count or a researched historical statistic. Ball ammunition normally uses `0`. |

Normal small-arms muzzle velocity belongs to the matching gun category because
barrel length changes it. Equivalent items with the same projectile/load may share
a category despite magazine capacity differences. Split tracer, AP, incendiary,
subsonic, explosive, or otherwise materially different loadings. Do not add
`AddRound`, `AddToAmmoGroup`, or ammo-level `MuzzleVelocity` unless the content
actually uses an ammunition-authoritative cannon, shell, or missile pattern.

### Shells and missiles: mandatory fields

A definition with `Shell True`, `Missile True`, `WeaponType Shell`, or
`WeaponType Missile` requires:

- projectile `Mass` in grams, or `MassKg` in kilograms, unless its statistics live in each `AddRound`;
- `MuzzleVelocity` in metres per second;
- normally `FallSpeed: 1.0`, except for a self-propelled projectile capable of
  sustained flight;
- `PenetrationAt100m` in millimetres at 100 m and normal impact whenever the
  intended value is nonzero;
- `ExplosiveMassTNTg` (grams) or `ExplosiveMassTNTKg` (kilograms) TNT equivalent whenever the intended value is
  nonzero. Omit it for genuinely inert ammunition such as many APCR projectiles.

These are gameplay-critical and ammunition-authoritative when present. Continue down
the source ladder rather than leaving a nonzero value unset. A weaker
configuration-compatible value is preferable to an absent value; record the fallback
and any conversion.

### Mixed autocannon belts with `AddRound`

Use `AddRound` only when one ammunition item contains multiple round types and its
definition has `RoundsPerItem > 1`. Each array element becomes one repeated legacy
line:

```json
"AddRound": [
    "AP 1 162 0 800 45",
    "HE 2 135 16 835 0"
]
```

The exact positional format is:

```text
<name> <count> <massG> <explosiveMassGTntEq> <muzzleVelocityMps> <penetrationAt100mMm>
```

Every entry has exactly six tokens:

- `name`: one-token round abbreviation; exact designations such as
  `Pzgr.L'Spur` and `Sprgr.` are allowed.
- `count`: positive number of consecutive shots in the repeating pattern.
- `massG`: projectile mass in grams.
- `explosiveMassGTntEq`: grams TNT equivalent; use `0` deliberately for an
  inert round.
- `muzzleVelocityMps`: exact projectile/load velocity in metres per second.
- `penetrationAt100mMm`: normal-impact millimetres at 100 m; use `0` only when no
  modeled armour penetration is intended.

Prefer a documented service belt. If none can be established, inspect every gun,
ground vehicle, and aircraft consuming the item. Bias an inferred belt toward AP
for principally ground-vehicle use and toward HE for principally aircraft use. A
repeating `1 AP : 1 HE` belt is an acceptable final gameplay default for genuine
shared use. Report inferred composition.

An `AddRound` category omits top-level `Mass`, `ExplosiveMassTNTg`/`ExplosiveMassTNTKg`, `MuzzleVelocity`,
and `PenetrationAt100m`; each active round supplies its own values. It still normally
has category-level `FallSpeed: 1.0`. Because `AddRound` accumulates with lines from
the definition and other categories, inspect every affected definition and avoid
accidentally appending a second belt. Validate `RoundsPerItem`, positional fields,
and the total repeating count.

### Individual cannon shells and ammunition groups

Use one category per selectable AP, APCR, HE, HEAT, smoke, missile, or other exact
round. The item supplies its own statistics and joins a compatible cannon family:

```json
"75mm Pzgr.39": {
    "properties": {
        "AddToAmmoGroup": "75mm KwK/PaK 40",
        "Mass": 6800,
        "MuzzleVelocity": 770,
        "FallSpeed": 1.0,
        "ExplosiveMassTNTg": 29,
        "PenetrationAt100m": 143
    },
    "items": [
        "shell_shortname"
    ]
}
```

- `AddToAmmoGroup` is the exact canonical compatible-ammunition family consumed by
  `UseAmmoGroup`. Matching is case-insensitive and names may contain spaces. Group
  weapons only when ammunition is actually compatible, not merely similar in
  calibre.
- `Mass` is complete fired projectile/shell mass in grams, excluding case and
  propellant. Author it in grams as `Mass`, or in kilograms as `MassKg` — the two are the
  same stat at different scales, so never set both.
- `MuzzleVelocity` is for this exact shell from the represented gun.
- `FallSpeed` is `1.0` for ballistic shells; sustained-flight projectiles are the
  exception.
- `ExplosiveMassTNTg` (grams) or `ExplosiveMassTNTKg` (kilograms) is the TNT equivalent of
  the bursting charge and is omitted only for genuinely non-explosive rounds. Pick whichever
  key keeps the number readable: grams below 1 kg, kilograms at or above it.
- `PenetrationAt100m` is millimetres at 100 m and normal impact, omitted only when
  zero is intentional.
- `FragType` is optional. For explosive cannon shells, use the supported enum that
  describes construction—usually `HE_SHELL`—rather than guessed numeric tuning.

Do not model an individually selectable shell as a mixed belt, or split a mixed
belt into ammo-group items when those rounds are not individually selectable.

`UseAmmoGroup` and `AddToAmmoGroup` are repeatable. Represent multiple values as a
JSON array so each becomes a separate legacy line:

```json
"UseAmmoGroup": [
    "75mm KwK/PaK 40",
    "Compatible 75mm Smoke"
]
```

Never place several group names after one legacy `UseAmmoGroup`; the parser treats
the entire remainder as one name. Validate membership in both directions and check
for duplicate ammunition after combining groups. Every vehicle with a real main
gun should use an existing matching group when its shells already define one. Do
not invent an empty group or attach an incompatible group; if no group exists,
leave it unset and report the missing cannon family unless the task includes adding
the shell categories.

## Per-Ammo Overrides

A gun, AA gun, or driveable can restate what one shared ammunition item does out of
its own barrel. These are weapon-category properties and belong in
`gun_categories.json`, `aagun_categories.json`, `vehicle_categories.json`, or
`plane_categories.json` — never in `bullet_categories.json`.

| Property | Format | Overrides |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `AmmoMass` | `<ammoShortName> <grams>` | the round's projectile mass |
| `AmmoMuzzleVelocity` | `<ammoShortName> <metresPerSecond>` | the round's muzzle velocity |
| `AmmoExplosiveMassTNTg` / `AmmoExplosiveMassTNTKg` | `<ammoShortName> <gTntEquivalent>` / `<ammoShortName> <kgTntEquivalent>` | the round's bursting charge, and the blast derived from it |
| `AmmoPenetrationAt100m` | `<ammoShortName> <millimetres>` | the round's armour penetration |
| `AddRoundForAmmo` | `<ammoShortName> <name> <count> <massG> [explG] [mps] [mm]` | the round's whole `AddRound` belt, replacing rather than appending |

All five are repeatable, so use a JSON array when a weapon restates more than one
ammunition:

```json
"UseAmmoGroup": "75mm KwK/PaK 40",
"AmmoMass": [
    "44_75apshell 6800",
    "44_smallheshell 5700"
],
"AmmoMuzzleVelocity": [
    "44_75apshell 770",
    "44_smallheshell 770"
]
```

Rules that matter when authoring them:

- The short name is the ammunition's **own `ShortName`**, matched case-insensitively.
- Each ammunition is overridden individually. Overriding one round says nothing about
  the others the weapon accepts.
- Resolution is against the weapon that fires. A driveable's own bank uses the
  driveable's overrides; the same driveable firing through an `AddGun`/`PilotGun`
  mount uses that gun's. Overrides never cascade from a driveable into its mounts, so
  put them on whichever definition actually declares the ammunition.
- Precedence per field: the scalar override, then `AddRoundForAmmo`, then the
  ammunition's own `AddRound`, then the ammunition's own top-level value, then for
  velocity only the weapon's `BulletSpeed`.
- An override may give a mass to a round that had none, which puts that round on the
  kinetic scale for that weapon alone. Use this deliberately, not accidentally.
- Overriding is the preferred answer to shared generic ammunition, because it lets
  every consumer fire its real round. See
  [generic-and-fictional.md](generic-and-fictional.md) R3.
- Keep an overridden set coherent: a weapon that restates velocity and penetration
  but leaves the item's mass alone is describing two different shells.

### Removing Ammunition

`RemoveAmmo <ammoShortName>` drops a round from a weapon. It is repeatable, one line
may name several rounds, and it is applied after `Ammo`, `AddAmmo` and every
`UseAmmoGroup`, so it takes precedence over all three.

Use it when a pack has handed a weapon ammunition it plainly could never fire - a
20.3 cm main battery fed the ship's 2 cm AA shell, say - or when a category
deliberately narrows what a weapon accepts. Do **not** use it merely because a round
is generic: shared generic ammunition is a per-ammo override problem, not a removal
problem, and removing it would leave a consumer with nothing to fire. Never remove a
weapon's only remaining ammunition.

```json
"Ammo": "ships_shell_german20cmhe",
"RemoveAmmo": "ships_shell_german20mmaa"
```

## Bombs And Dropped Ordnance

`bullets` definitions whose `WeaponType` resolves to `BOMB` or `MINE`, including the
legacy `Bomb True` shorthand, are ammunition in `bullet_categories.json`, not
grenades. They are researched like grenades — the value that matters is the
explosive charge — but they carry a bomb's mass, they are released from a driveable
rather than thrown, and their `Fuse` means something different.

Torpedoes (`Torpedo True`) and depth charges are usually authored as bombs or
missiles by the pack. Follow the definition, not the name.

### Mandatory and expected fields

| Property | Unit | Requirement |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ExplosiveMassTNTg` / `ExplosiveMassTNTKg` | grams / kilograms TNT equivalent | Mandatory for every bomb with a charge. Derive from filler mass and composition, never from the bomb's total weight. Omit only for genuinely inert practice or ballast stores. |
| `FragType` | enum | Required. Chosen from casing construction, not from the word in the name. |
| `Mass` / `MassKg` | grams / kilograms | Expected. For a bomb this is the **complete filled store**, because the whole bomb is what falls and strikes — unlike a shell, where case and propellant are excluded. It enables the kinetic system for direct hits. |
| `FallSpeed` | multiplier | `1.0` for a free-fall bomb. A retarded, parachute-braked, or glide store is the exception; reduce it or use `DragInAir` and report the choice. |
| `PenetrationAt100m` | millimetres | Only for armour-piercing and semi-armour-piercing bombs with a real deck- or concrete-penetration figure. Omit for ordinary general-purpose bombs. |

Do not author `MuzzleVelocity` or `BulletSpeed` for a gravity bomb; it is released
at the carrier's velocity and an authored value overrides that. Rocket-boosted and
glide weapons are the exception and are usually `Missile` definitions anyway.

### `Fuse` on a bomb is not a grenade fuse

For a grenade, `Fuse` is the nominal timed delay after which it detonates. For a
bullet-type entity, `Fuse` is a **maximum airborne lifetime in ticks**, after which
the projectile is removed and detonates in mid-air. It is a self-destruct ceiling,
not a historical arming delay.

Consequences:

- Do not convert a bomb's real arming or delay-fuse time into `Fuse`. A 0.01-second
  instantaneous nose fuse authored as `Fuse 0` would be ignored; authored as a small
  number it would detonate the bomb the instant it leaves the aircraft.
- Leave the definition's authored value alone for an ordinary impact-fused bomb.
  Packs typically use 200 ticks. Gravity is real at `9.81 / 400` blocks per tick
  squared, so ten seconds of fall covers far more than the world's build height and
  the cap never fires in practice.
- Author `Fuse` in a category only when the ordnance genuinely has a timed function
  the lifetime cap can represent: a depth charge set to a stated depth, an airburst
  or dispenser store, or a delayed-action mine. Convert as `ticks = seconds * 20` and
  say in the report what the timer represents.

### Charge-to-weight ratio method

Most bomb sources give a nominal weight and a filler, not a TNT equivalent. Derive
`ExplosiveMassTNTg`/`ExplosiveMassTNTKg` as:

```text
explosiveMassKgTnt = totalBombMassKg * chargeToWeightRatio * tntEquivalenceFactor
```

Use the documented filler mass whenever one exists. Fall back to the construction's
ratio band only when it does not, and report the fallback.

| Construction | Charge-to-weight ratio | Usual `FragType` |
| --- | --- | --- |
| General-purpose bomb | 0.45 – 0.55 | `GP_BOMB` |
| Light-case / high-capacity blast bomb | 0.70 – 0.80 | `LOW_FRAG` |
| Fragmentation bomb | 0.10 – 0.20 | `HIGH_FRAG` |
| Semi-armour-piercing bomb | 0.20 – 0.30 | `THICK_CASE` |
| Armour-piercing / penetrator bomb | 0.05 – 0.15 | `THICK_CASE` |
| Depth charge | 0.35 – 0.55 | `LOW_FRAG` |
| Naval mine | 0.30 – 0.50 | `LOW_FRAG` |
| Torpedo warhead section | as documented warhead mass | `THICK_CASE` |
| Cluster dispenser | sum of submunition charges | `AIRBURST_AP` |
| Incendiary bomb | charge is the incendiary fill | `LOW_FRAG` |

Then apply the filler's TNT equivalence: Amatol 80/20 about 0.90–1.0, TNT 1.0,
Tritonal about 1.05–1.10, Trialen about 1.20–1.30, RDX and Composition B about
1.30–1.35, Torpex about 1.40–1.50. Record the composition and the factor.

A cluster or submunition dispenser sets its own `ExplosiveMassTNTg`/`ExplosiveMassTNTKg` from its own burster
only; the submunition it spawns is a separate definition with its own category, and
authoring the total payload on both double-counts the damage.

Nuclear and thermonuclear stores need no special treatment in the category. Author
the real yield as kilograms of TNT equivalent like any other charge - a 50 Mt device
is `50000000000` - and let the server's `maxExplosionRadius` setting bound what is
actually simulated. That ceiling is a performance guard applied to every detonation's
radii at runtime; it leaves the authored charge, and therefore the damage, honest.
Never bake a gameplay cap into `ExplosiveMassTNTg`/`ExplosiveMassTNTKg`: doing so silently misreports the
weapon and cannot be tuned per server.

### Grouping and splitting

Split by nominal weight and construction: an SC 250 and an SC 500 are separate
categories, and a 500 lb GP bomb and a 500 lb SAP bomb are separate categories.
Do not split by carrier aircraft, by icon, or by which weapon bank the pack put the
store in. Exact aliases across packs share one category.

Generic bombs whose only stated property is a nominal weight follow the generic
doctrine in [generic-and-fictional.md](generic-and-fictional.md); the ratio table
above is the correct derivation for them, using the general-purpose band unless the
definition says otherwise.

## Grenades

Research and define:

| Property | Unit | Guidance |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `ExplosiveMassTNTg` / `ExplosiveMassTNTKg` | grams / kilograms TNT equivalent | Mandatory for every grenade with an explosive charge. Use an exact TNT-equivalent figure when available; otherwise derive it from documented filler mass and composition using a defensible TNT-equivalence factor. Omit only when the grenade has no explosive charge. |
| `FragType` | enum | Choose from casing/design and intended fragmentation: `LOW_FRAG`, `STD_FRAG`, `SLEEVE_FRAG`, `HIGH_FRAG`, `IED_SHRAPNEL`, `HE_SHELL`, `GP_BOMB`, `THICK_CASE`, or `AIRBURST_AP`; `DEFAULT` opts out of a preset. |
| `Fuse` | ticks | Use nominal timed delay multiplied by 20. Omit for impact, proximity, mine, or other non-timed behavior and when timing cannot be established defensibly. |

Distinguish nominal fuse delay from tolerance range. A fragmentation sleeve changes
`FragType`; it does not automatically alter explosive mass. Determine fragmentation
from physical construction and intended behavior, not only from the word
"fragmentation" in a name. Never use total grenade weight as filler mass or assume
TNT when a different charge is documented; record the composition, conversion, and
any lower-tier source in the task report.
