/**
 * Decides which shared keys the controls screen should stop calling a conflict.
 *
 * <p>Two mappings only really clash if a player can reach both at the same
 * moment. Forge cannot express that on its own: {@code KeyMapping.same} ends
 * with a bare key comparison whenever two conflict contexts do not conflict, and
 * every vanilla mapping is {@link KeyConflictContext#UNIVERSAL}, which conflicts
 * with everything. So the flight axes on W/A/S/D would be drawn red against both
 * the ground vehicle binds and vanilla walking, neither of which a pilot can use
 * while flying.</p>
 *
 * <p>A pair is hidden when it cannot bite: the two are never live at the same
 * moment, or the action being displaced is one this mod deliberately takes over
 * while the player is at the controls. Anything a player would actually want to
 * know about still shows up.</p>
 *
 * <p>This is presentation only. {@code KeyMapping.same} has exactly one caller
 * in the game, the row colouring in {@code KeyBindsList}, so nothing here can
 * change what a key does.</p>
