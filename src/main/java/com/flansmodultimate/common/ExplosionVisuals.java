/**
 * How big an explosion <em>looks</em>, derived from how big it actually is.
 * <p>
 * The damage model already knows the three radii that matter - the crater it carves, the
 * overpressure envelope and how far fragments reach - so the visuals are shaped from those rather
 * than from a content pack's flat particle counts, which do not scale with the charge at all. One
 * class decides the whole budget so the layers stay in proportion to each other: a round whose
 * fireball is small should not also be the one leaving a smoke column standing.
 * <p>
 * The governing idea is that small-calibre HE is <em>brief</em>. A .50 cal or a 20 mm round puts a
 * few grams of filler into the air; it flashes, throws a little dirt and is over inside half a
 * second. Everything here therefore keys off {@link #intensity(float)}, which is near zero for
 * those rounds and only reaches one for a charge in the tens of kilograms. At the bottom of that
 * curve particles live a fraction of their authored lifetime and the extra layers switch off
 * entirely; at the top they live longer than authored, there are several times as many of them, and
 * the blast and fragmentation envelopes get visuals of their own so the radii that hurt you are
 * also the radii you can see.
