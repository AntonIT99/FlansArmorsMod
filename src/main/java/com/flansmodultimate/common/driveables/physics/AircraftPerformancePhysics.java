/**
 * Derived fixed-wing performance for aircraft running the real-world profile.
 *
 * <p>Three quantities are derived here, all from data a reference book actually
 * lists: thrust (directly, or from shaft power and a propeller efficiency), a
 * reference airspeed standing in for stall behaviour, and a roll inertia factor.
 *
 * <p>Stall is deliberately soft. Real stall speeds for heavily loaded aircraft
 * are unpleasant at Minecraft scale, so the derived reference speed is clamped to
 * a fraction of the aircraft's own terminal speed and lift falls off smoothly
 * below it rather than vanishing at a hard threshold.
 *
 * <p>Only {@code EnumPlaneMode.PLANE} consumes this. Helicopter, VTOL and six
 * degree of freedom craft keep their legacy behaviour untouched.
