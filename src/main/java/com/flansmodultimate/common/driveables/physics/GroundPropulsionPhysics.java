/**
 * Derived longitudinal acceleration for ground vehicles running the real-world
 * profile.
 *
 * <p>Power to weight is an input to this model, not the answer. Treating kW/kg
 * directly as blocks per tick squared would make acceleration independent of
 * current speed, so a vehicle would either snap to its top speed or never reach
 * it. Instead this is a constant-power tractive force opposed by a resistance
 * term that is calibrated to balance exactly at the authored top speed:
 *
 * <pre>
 * F_traction(v) = P / max(v, v_launch)          capped by the traction limit
 * F_resist(v)   = k * v^2,  with k = P / v_max^3
 * a(v)          = (F_traction(v) - F_resist(v)) / m
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>Because {@code F_traction(v_max) == F_resist(v_max)} by construction, the
 * vehicle approaches {@code v_max} asymptotically and never overshoots it. All
 * work is done in SI and converted once at the end, so the formulas stay
 * readable and unit-checkable.
