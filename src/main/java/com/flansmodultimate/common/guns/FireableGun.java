/**
 * The weapon side of a shot: everything the firing weapon contributes, with the ammunition
 * deliberately left out.
 *
 * <p>Velocity is split in two so that ammunition can take precedence without losing what the
 * weapon does to it. {@link #bulletSpeed} is the velocity the weapon supplies <em>on its own</em>
 * and is only a fallback for ammunition that declares no {@code MuzzleVelocity};
 * {@link #bulletSpeedMultiplier} is applied on top of whichever velocity wins, so a barrel
 * attachment still speeds up a round that states its own muzzle velocity.
 * {@link FiredShot#getMuzzleVelocity()} is the single place those two are combined.
